Whether you're a beginner eager to learn about classic AI techniques or an experienced practitioner exploring different approaches, this collection offers a diverse set of algorithms for experimentation.

# Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various AI algorithms. Each algorithm is described briefly below:

## Search Algorithms
1. **A* (Astar) Algorithm**:
   - A heuristic search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes.
   - Combines the cost to reach a node with an estimate of the remaining cost to the goal.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
   - Uses a stack to keep track of nodes.

3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**:
   - Explores the least-cost path first.
   - Uses a priority queue based on path cost.

4. **Greedy Algorithm**:
   - Chooses the next step based solely on the heuristic value (ignores path cost).
   - Often used for optimization problems.

5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level.
   - Uses a queue for traversal.

## Optimization Algorithms
1. **Genetic Algorithm**:
   - Inspired by natural selection and genetics.
   - Used for optimization and search problems.
   - Involves populations, selection, crossover, and mutation.

2. **Hill Climbing**:
   - Iteratively improves a solution by making small adjustments.
   - Stops when no better solution can be found in the neighborhood.

3. **8-Queens Problem**:
   - Solves the classic problem of placing 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard.
   - Ensures that no two queens threaten each other.

4. **Minimax Algorithm**:
   - Used in game theory for decision-making.
   - Finds the best move in a two-player game.

5. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**:
   - Enhances the minimax algorithm by reducing the number of nodes evaluated.
   - Prunes branches that cannot affect the final decision.

## Heuristic
- **Manhattan Distance**:
  - A common heuristic for grid-based pathfinding.
  - Measures the distance between two points along the grid lines.
